# tictactoe-python
This is a simple GUI-based Tic Tac Toe game built using Python and Tkinter. It allows two players to play against each other by taking turns, displaying the current player's symbol (X or O), and checking for wins or draws. A pop-up message shows the result, and the game can be restarted after each round.
